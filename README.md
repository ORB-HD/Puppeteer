Tip of the day: try the new scripting feature by running

    ./puppeteer subject3m.lua -s scripts/motionsickness.lua
    
# Usage

Puppeteer comes with an example model and motion capture data. To load them
pass both model and motion capture data as arguments to the Puppeteer
executable, e.g.:

    ./puppeteer model.lua data/testdata.c3d
    
# Build

Do a recursive clone of the repoistory to also initialise all subrepos:

>	git clone --recursive https://github.com/ORB-HD/puppeteer
	
if not do you will have to initialise them yourself: 

>	git submodule init
>	
>	git submodule update
	

# Dependencies

Puppeteer requires RBDL, the Rigid Body Dynamics Library that you can
obtain from https://rbdl.bitbucket.org (open-source, zlib).

Additionally Puppeteer uses the following libraries and includes them in
the `vendor/` folder:

  * c3dfile (c3d file parsing, MIT license)
  * LuaTables++ (LuaModel reading/writing, MIT License)
	* TCLAP (command line parsing, MIT license)
	* QtPropertyBrowser (Property widget, BSD license)

# Changelog

	* 2015-10-13: ensure that model markers are always sorted alphabetically
		in the GUI
